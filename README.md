# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to examine the number and positions of retirement-eligible employees in the company Pewlett-Hackard, and begin to scope possible solutions and opportunities to address the coming labor shortage. 

## Results
The results are very concerning for the company. There are just over 90,000 employees nearing or at retirement eligibility. Predictably, given that these employees are older and presumably more experienced, these positions fall disproportionately in the higher-level positions of the company. In particular, nearly 30,000 of each Senior Staff and Senior Engineers are retirement-eligible. Staff and Engineer both account for about half of that number, with 14,000 and 12,000 retirement-eligible staff, respectively. 

The potential for a mentorship program, by which retiring employees step in and mentor those currently in the company to ensure they are prepared to take over, is promising, however, the scale of the need is much higher. Only 1,550 staff are eligible by the filters given us, meaning the company would need to either expand the eligibility, or begin an aggressive hiring campaign in order to ensure no impact to company performance. 

## Summary
In summary, there is a serious concern for a loss of staff experience and expertise for the company, without serious action. A total of 90,000 staff are eligible for retirement, and only 3,000 in a position to effectivley step in.
